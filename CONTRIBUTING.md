#### Security vulnerabilities

We take the security of Kani and our users very seriously. As such, we encourage responsible disclosure of security
vulnerabilities in Kani.

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in Kani, please report it in accordance with

### Code contributions

Code contributions are often the most helpful way to contribute to this project, and all code contributions will be
greatly appreciated!

You can contribute code changes that you have written for Kani
by [creating a Pull Request](https://github.com/HyperaDev/kani/compare).

#### Testing

Adding test coverage is extremely helpful and highly recommended for any major changes you make.  
Testing helps us catch problems early before they have the change to cause big issues in production.

#### Commit messages

Whilst not required for commits in pull requests, all commits made in the `main` branch **must**
follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
This allows for the Git history to be more readable and helps us generate changelogs automatically.

##### Allowed types

- `fix`, when the commit fixes a bug or other issue.
- `feat`, when adding a new feature.
- `refactor`, when refactoring or improving existing code.
- `build`, when modifying a build file.
- `ci`, when modifying a GitHub Actions workflow.
- `docs`, when changing documentation.
- `style`, when correcting a code-style issue.
- `perf`, when improving the performance of a feature.
- `test`, when adding or improving tests.
- `chore`, when doing something that does not fit into the types above.

##### Allowed scopes

- `deps`, when adding, updating, or removing dependencies.
- `docker`, when modifying Dockerfiles.

#### Code review

We will **not** merge any pull request that does not build, pass all tests, or have style violations.
**All** code contributions must be licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), and must be reviewed by
the [code owners](https://github.com/HyperaDev/kani/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) for the file(s) you are editing.

All reviews will be strict to prevent problems or mistakes from being merged into the repository.  
If you have spotted a problem or mistake in someone else's pull request, please feel free to leave a polite comment to
make everyone else aware of the problem before it gets merged.
